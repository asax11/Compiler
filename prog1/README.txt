What doesn’t work: Our strings work for the most part, however, if there is any text following a special character, the lexical analyzer gets confused. We are not sure why this is the case. A string like “abc \n \” \\” works as intended, but “abc\n\” \\” does not. Other than that, everything works as intended.
